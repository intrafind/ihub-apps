## 🏢 Architecture & Implementation

### Server

The server is implemented as a Node.js application, likely using a framework like Express.js to provide a REST API gateway. Its primary responsibilities include:

- **Configuration Loading:** Reads configuration files (e.g., JSON) defining available apps, language models (LLMs), endpoints, API keys, default styles, and the disclaimer text.
- **API Endpoints:**
  /api
  /api/apps
  /api/apps/{appId}
  /api/apps/{appId}/chat
  /api/apps/{appId}/chat/{chatId} #openai compatible chat completions endpoint, which supports streaming
  /api/models
  /api/models/{modelId}
  /api/models/{modelId}/chat #openai compatible chat completions endpoint, which supports streaming
  /api/disclaimer
  - Provides endpoints for the frontend to fetch the list of available apps (`/api/apps`).
  - Provides endpoints to fetch the list of available models (`/api/models`).
  - Provides an endpoint to fetch the disclaimer text (`/api/disclaimer`).
  - Provides the main endpoint for handling chat interactions (`/api/chat` or similar).

- **LLM Interaction:**
  - Receives chat messages from the frontend (formatted according to OpenAI's message structure).
  - Identifies the target LLM based on the user's selection or app configuration.
  - Forwards the request, including the conversation history and system prompt, to the appropriate remote LLM API endpoint.
  - Manages API keys required for different LLM services.
- **Response Streaming:** Receives the response stream from the LLM and forwards it back to the connected frontend client using either WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates.

## Initial Concept

We want to build an application for users to get started working with AI-enabled applications. These applications are using LLMs and we want to let user use them to support their daily work.
The application consists of a start page. When the user opens the start page, the user will be asked for a username, which is only stored in browser local storage, but also used when using our apps. We use this name to personalize the experience as well as tracking who did what. The user can decide to stay anonymous, in this case we generate a username.
When the user returns to the web application, we will show them their last name, if available. Below the input for the username, we also show a disclaimer, which has been loaded from the backend.
After the user has chosen a username on the start page, the web application switches to the next screen. This app overview screen shows his/her/its name and loads the apps from the backend. A maximum of 7 apps are shown. If we have more apps, we show also show a more button. The apps which are loaded from the backend, can be configured in a json file in the backend. Each app consists of a name, a description, a color, an icon, a system, a token limit, a preferred model, a preferred output format (like markdown, html, pure text, ...) and an optional prompt which can contain variables. These variables can have a type like string, date, number or boolean. The variables can have predefined values which consists of a label as well as a text which will be used for replacing the variable in the prompt. The variables will be used to adjust the frontend and allow the user a simpler work / guidance what to fill out.
When a user has selected an app, the chat application opens, where the user can simply chat with the llms. These apps will help the user to translate text, these apps are specialized in generating content, these apps can be used to summarize content incl. voice of tone, writing style as well as the action for the summary like "just summarize", "extract the key facts", "highlight actions items", "list all decisions", "summarize and provide recommendations" or nothing as well as free text or just a full custom app, where the user can enter the system as well as user prompt.
At the app overview page the user can also search for apps via a search box on the page. The search is done purely on the client side.
A user can favorize apps as well as we are tracking which apps he/she/it has used before. This tracking is done in the browser and connected to the username. If the user has chosen a different name, they will not see the used apps from the last time.
When a user has chosen the app, the client will render a chat interface as well as a panel with the information about the app and if the app contains variables with the input fields. It is also possible to expand the system prompt and the normal prompt as well as an option to edit them. A user can save the changes, but they are not written back. A hint should be shown to the user that the changes are only temporarily until the next login.
When a user fills out the optional fields for the variables and enters their text for translation, summarization or whatever the apps is able to do, it will send all the information to the backend in the message format used by OpenAI to simulate a conversion between the assistant and the user.
The backend will send it to an OpenAI compatible LLM hosted remotely and waits for the answer to be streamed back. Our backend will then stream it to our frontend via either Websockets or Server Sent Events.

Example:
instructions: "Talk like a pirate.", #system prompt
input=[
{"role": "user", "content": "knock knock."},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Who's there?"},
{"role": "user", "content": "Orange."},
] #the messages between the user and the assistant
We will send all messages which have been send before with the request, so we can simulate a conversion and allow the model to use the asked information before. For example, if we have asked to summarize it and afterwards ask to translate it, the llm knows that it has to use the summarized text.
We have to be careful about the context window. This means we should count the tokens on client side and check it against the limit configured in each app.
Our application will also load the available models from our server and if multiples ones are configured, we allow the user to switch the model. Each model has a remote url, an optional api key, a human readable name and a description what it excels in. Depending on the model, our backend will send the request to the configured url.
The conversation in our app looks like a chat with an assistant. A user can modify their input, they can send it again, can copy the text to easily extract it, allow a download for an answer as well as the whole chat.
The user can also tell the assistant how they want to have their response formatted. The user can also chose a certain writing style. Styles allow the user to customize how llm communicates, helping you achieve more while working in a way that feels natural to you. Styles could be:

Normal: Default responses from Claude

Concise: Shorter and more direct responses

Formal: Clear and polished responses

Explanatory: Educational responses for learning new concepts
The default styles are also configured on the backend side and loaded from our web application.
But also custom styles are possible, which are stored in the local storage.

All keys as well as texts has to support i18n / localization.
Therefore we want to build a web application which talks through a small node.js service with the LLMs.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.x or higher (for building)
- npm 8.x or higher

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ihub-apps
   npm run install:all
   ```

2. **Run in development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm run electron:dev
   ```

3. **Build desktop installers:**

   ```bash
   npm run electron:build
   ```

   This creates platform-specific installers in the `dist-electron/` directory.

4. **Connect to remote server (optional):**

   ```bash
   REMOTE_SERVER_URL=https://your-server.com npm run electron:dev
   ```

**Electron Features:**

- ✅ **Native desktop experience** - System tray, notifications, file associations
- ✅ **Offline capable** - Can work without internet connection
- ✅ **Cross-platform** - Windows, macOS, and Linux applications
- ✅ **Remote server support** - Connect to existing iHub Apps deployments

### Automatic Configuration Setup

**New in this version**: iHub Apps automatically sets up default configuration when you start the server for the first time!

- ✅ **Zero Configuration**: No manual setup required
- ✅ **Smart Detection**: Only runs setup when the contents directory is empty
- ✅ **Non-Destructive**: Never overwrites existing configuration files
- ✅ **Works Everywhere**: Development, production, and packaged binary deployments

**What happens on first startup:**

1. Server checks if the `contents` directory is empty
2. If empty, copies default configuration from `server/defaults`
3. Includes all apps, models, prompts, and platform settings
4. Server continues normal startup with the new configuration

**Custom contents directory:**

```bash
# Use a different directory for configuration
CONTENTS_DIR=my-custom-config npm run dev
```

The automatic setup works with any custom contents directory you specify.

### Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the Node.js server on port 3000
- Launch the Vite development server for the client
- Enable hot reloading for both client and server changes

### Code Quality and Linting

The project uses automated linting and formatting to ensure code quality:

```bash
# Check all files for linting issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix linting issues where possible
npm run lint:fix

# Format all files with Prettier
npm run format

# Check if files are properly formatted
npm run format:check
```

**Automated Systems:**

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Automatically run linting on staged files
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions runs linting checks on PRs and pushes
- **ESLint 9.x**: Modern flat config with comprehensive rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting

**Important**: Always run `npm run lint:fix` before committing. Pre-commit hooks will prevent commits with linting errors.

### Testing Server Startup

After making changes to server code, always test that the server starts correctly:

```bash
# Run linting first, then test server startup
npm run lint:fix

# Test server startup with timeout to catch errors quickly
timeout 10s node server/server.js || echo "Server startup check completed"

# Test full development environment
timeout 15s npm run dev || echo "Development environment startup check completed"
```

This should be done after every build or significant refactoring to ensure no linting errors, import errors, missing dependencies, or runtime errors.

## 🏭 Building for Production

### Standard Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run prod:build
```

This creates a `dist` directory containing:

- Optimized client build in `dist/public`
- Server files in `dist/server`
- Application content and configuration in `dist/contents`
- Example setups in `dist/examples`
- Production dependencies alongside `package.json`

To start the production build:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

### Building Your Own Binary (Advanced)

**For developers:** You can build your own binary from source.

**Prerequisite:** Node.js 20 or newer is required for creating the binary.

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node -v

# Build binary from source
./build.sh --binary
```

This creates versioned executables in the `dist-bin` directory along with configuration files and assets.

## Configuration

### Server Configuration

The server can be configured through environment variables or by editing the `config.env` file:

| Variable            | Description                | Default     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `PORT`              | Port the server listens on | `3000`      |
| `HOST`              | Host interface to bind to  | `0.0.0.0`   |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`   | LLM request timeout (ms)   | `60000`     |
| `WORKERS`           | Number of cluster workers  | `CPU count` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`    | OpenAI API key             | (required)  |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key          | (required)  |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY`    | Google AI API key          | (required)  |

The maximum JSON request body size is configured via the `requestBodyLimitMB` option in `contents/config/platform.json`.
Outbound request concurrency can also be tuned with the `requestConcurrency` setting in the same file and overridden per model or tool. Values below `1` or an omitted setting result in unlimited concurrency.

### SSL Configuration

For HTTPS support, set these environment variables or define them in `config.env`:

| Variable   | Description                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| `SSL_KEY`  | Path to SSL private key           |
| `SSL_CERT` | Path to SSL certificate           |
| `SSL_CA`   | Path to CA certificate (optional) |

For handling external services with self-signed certificates, see [docs/ssl-certificates.md](docs/ssl-certificates.md).

Example of running with custom configuration:

```bash
PORT=8080 HOST=127.0.0.1 WORKERS=4 npm run start:prod
```

Or with the binary (replace `${VERSION}` with the current version):

```bash
PORT=8080 HOST=127.0.0.1 WORKERS=4 ./dist-bin/ihub-apps-v${VERSION}-macos
```

## 🔐 Authentication and Authorization

iHub Apps includes a comprehensive authentication system supporting multiple authentication modes with enterprise-grade security.

### Authentication Modes

The system supports four authentication modes with **dual authentication capability**:

| Mode          | Description                | Use Case                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Anonymous** | No authentication required | Public demos, open access           |
| **Local**     | Built-in username/password | Development, small teams            |
| **OIDC**      | OpenID Connect integration | Enterprise SSO, Google, Microsoft   |
| **Proxy**     | Reverse proxy + Pure JWT   | nginx, OAuth2 Proxy, corporate auth |

**NEW**: Multiple authentication methods can be enabled simultaneously! Users can authenticate via local login, OIDC providers, or JWT tokens based on their preference and your configuration.

### Quick Start

**Default Setup (No Authentication):**

```bash
# Just start the application - works out of the box!
npm run dev
```

All users have full access to all apps and features by default.

**Enable Local Authentication:**

```bash
# Set environment variables
export LOCAL_AUTH_ENABLED=true
export JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret

# Or edit contents/config/platform.json
{
  "auth": { "mode": "local" },
  "localAuth": { "enabled": true }
}
```

**Enable Dual Authentication (Local + OIDC):**

```json
{
  "auth": { "mode": "oidc" },
  "localAuth": { "enabled": true },
  "oidcAuth": { "enabled": true }
}
```

**Enable Pure JWT Authentication:**

```json
{
  "auth": { "mode": "proxy" },
  "proxyAuth": {
    "enabled": true,
    "jwtProviders": [
      {
        "name": "your-provider",
        "issuer": "https://your-provider.com",
        "audience": "ihub-apps",
        "jwkUrl": "https://your-provider.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Demo Accounts:**

- Admin: `admin` / `password123`
- User: `user` / `password123`

### Admin Access Security

The admin panel uses a **strict security model** based on authentication mode:

| Auth Mode            | Admin Access          | Admin Secret |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Anonymous**        | Admin secret required | ✅ Enabled   |
| **Local/OIDC/Proxy** | User groups only      | ❌ Disabled  |

**Benefits:**

- **No bypass attacks** - Admin secret can't bypass proper authentication
- **Dynamic admin groups** - Configure admin access without code changes
- **Seamless UX** - Admin users go directly to admin panel

### Permission System

Access control uses group-based permissions:

```json
{
  "groups": {
    "admin": {
      "apps": ["*"],
      "prompts": ["*"],
      "models": ["*"],
      "adminAccess": true
    },
    "user": {
      "apps": ["chat", "translator"],
      "prompts": ["general"],
      "models": ["gpt-3.5-turbo"],
      "adminAccess": false
    }
  }
}
```

### ⚙️ Configuration

Authentication is configured in `contents/config/platform.json`:

```json
{
  "auth": {
    "mode": "local",
    "authenticatedGroup": "authenticated"
  },
  "anonymousAuth": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "authorization": {
    "adminGroups": ["admin", "admins"],
    "userGroups": ["user", "users"]
  }
}
```

### apps.json

This file defines all available applications in the iHub. Each app has the following structure:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "name": {
    "en": "App Name",
    "de": "App Name German"
  },
  "description": {
    "en": "Short description of the app",

          "label": {
            "en": "Option 1",
            "de": "Option 1 DE"
          },
          "value": "option1-value"
        }
      ],
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Variable types can be:

- `string`: Text input
- `text`: Multi-line text input
- `date`: Date picker

## 🌍 Localization

The application supports internationalization through localization files:

### Server-side Localization

Server-side strings are built into the application under `shared/i18n/{lang}.json`.
Create files in `contents/locales/{lang}.json` to override individual keys if customization is needed.

### Client-side Localization

Client-side translations are shared with the server and stored in `shared/i18n/{lang}.json`.

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new JSON file in `shared/i18n/` named after the language code (e.g., `fr.json`).
2. Optionally create an override file in `contents/locales/` if you need to customize specific keys.
3. Copy the structure from an existing language file and translate all values.
4. Update the language selector in `client/src/components/LanguageSelector.jsx` to include the new language.

## 📝 Creating Custom Pages

Custom pages can be added through the `ui.json` configuration in the `pages` section:

1. Add a new entry to the `pages` object:

   ```json
   "pages": {
     "page-id": {
       "title": {
         "en": "Page Title",
         "de": "Seitentitel"
       },
       "content": {
         "en": "# Page content in markdown format",
         "de": "# Seiteninhalt im Markdown-Format"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. The content field supports Markdown, which will be rendered by the application.

3. To link to the page from the header, add an entry to the `header.links` array:

   ```json
   "header": {
     "links": [
       {
         "name": {
           "en": "Page Title",
           "de": "Seitentitel"
         },
         "url": "/page/page-id"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. To link to the page from the footer, add an entry to the `footer.links` array:
   ```json
   "footer": {
     "links": [
       {
         "name": {
           "en": "Page Title",
           "de": "Seitentitel"
         },
         "url": "/page/page-id"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

Custom pages are rendered using the `UnifiedPage` component and are accessible at the path `/page/{id}`.

### React Component Pages

iHub Apps supports dynamic React component rendering for advanced page functionality:

1. **Create React component files** in `contents/pages/{lang}/{page-id}.jsx`
2. **Component Structure**:

   ```jsx
   function UserComponent(props) {
     const { React, useState, useEffect, t, navigate, user } = props;

     return <div className="p-4">{/* Your component JSX */}</div>;
   }
   ```

3. **Available Props**: Full React hooks, translation function, navigation, user context
4. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes available
5. **Auto-detection**: System automatically detects React vs Markdown content

For more details, see [React Component Feature](docs/react-component-feature.md).
