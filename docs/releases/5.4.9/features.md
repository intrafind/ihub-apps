# Features — 5.4.9

## Ephemeral Chat Is Now a First-Class Toggle

Ephemeral (never-stored) chat moves out of the settings dialog and becomes a ghost-icon toggle
directly below the chat input, next to the send button — working like a browser's incognito mode.

- While active, the chat input is highlighted in violet and a notice states that messages are not
  saved and disappear when leaving or reloading — so users always know the conversation is private.
- Behavior is unchanged: ephemeral chats are never written to browser storage and no iAssistant
  conversation ID is persisted.
- The app-level configuration is the same: `ephemeral: true` presets the toggle, and
  `settings.ephemeral.enabled: false` hides it.

## PowerPoint Files Are Now Read Properly (and Binary Files Rejected)

Uploaded or email-attached PowerPoint decks are now converted to real slide text before being sent
to the model. Previously `.pptx` files had no text extractor, so the raw file container was sent as
unreadable characters — a single deck could silently flood the model's entire context window and
fail the request with a context-size error.

- `.pptx` content arrives at the model as clean, slide-numbered text.
- Legacy binary `.ppt` files (and other unreadable binary formats) are rejected with an
  "unsupported format" message instead of being sent as garbage.

## Outlook Add-in: Token Estimate Now Counts Attachments

The context-usage indicator under the chat input now includes the extracted text of email
attachments (from the open email and all pinned emails). Previously only the typed message and
email bodies were counted, so the indicator could show a few thousand tokens while the actual
request was far above the model's context window.

## Answer-Source Badge Fixed for Apps with Tools

Answers based on email content or uploaded files now show the correct "Based on email content" /
"Based on uploaded file" badge in apps that have tools enabled. Previously these apps always
reported "Based on AI knowledge" because the source tracking was lost in the tool-execution path.
