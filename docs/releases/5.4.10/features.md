## Answer-Source Badge No Longer Drops to "AI Knowledge" on Non-Standard Completions

The "Based on uploaded file / email content" badge is now emitted on every way a chat turn can
finish, not just the clean streaming completion. Previously the badge was attached only when the
model stream ended with an explicit completion signal, so answers that finished another way — a
dropped/closed connection, a streaming ("passthrough") tool, or a run that hit the tool-iteration
limit — silently fell back to "Based on AI knowledge" even though a file or email was in context.

- Applies to both the standard chat path and apps with tools enabled.
- Source attribution is also cleared reliably at the end of each turn, so a later message in the
  same conversation can no longer inherit a stale badge.
- On error/aborted turns the badge is intentionally not shown, since the assistant bubble is an
  error message rather than a real answer.
