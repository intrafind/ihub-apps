## Outlook Add-in: Reliable Email and Attachment Sync

The Outlook task pane now follows the selected email reliably. Previously, switching emails could
leave the previous email's attachments in the context strip — shown as failed ("not part of this
mail") — while the new email's attachments never appeared, and using "Add email(s)" could freeze
the pane on the old email entirely. Both required closing and reopening the add-in.

- Switching emails always loads the new email's subject, body, and attachments; a read that
  overlaps a quick switch is retried against the newly selected email instead of showing stale data.
- "Add email(s)" no longer freezes the pane: the pinned email is captured without disturbing the
  live Outlook selection, so the context strip keeps updating as you move between emails.
- Attachment reads are far less chatty with the Outlook host, improving task-pane responsiveness
  on emails with large attachments.
