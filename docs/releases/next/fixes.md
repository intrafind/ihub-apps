## OpenAPI Tools: Array Parameters

Array query parameters of OpenAPI tools declared in `form` style are now sent as the document
says (repeated by default, comma-joined for `explode: false`) instead of always comma-joined,
which APIs such as CKAN rejected. `spaceDelimited` and `pipeDelimited` arrays are still sent
comma-joined. A tool may also set `openapi.arrayStyle` to `json-list`.
