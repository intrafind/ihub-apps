# Fixes — Unreleased

## iHub Support Bot: Documentation Available in Docker and Production Builds

In Docker images, the iHub Support Bot had no iHub documentation to answer from, and installations
built with `npm run prod:build` could ship the documentation of an earlier build or none at all —
the documentation source was generated after the server files were packaged, or not at all. Every
build now generates it before packaging, so the bot answers from the documentation of the version
it runs.

## MCP Servers Using Streamable HTTP Connect Reliably

Connecting to an MCP server over Streamable HTTP often failed with `406 Not Acceptable`, or the
connection test and tool calls timed out. iHub dropped the request headers the protocol requires
and could not read streamed (`text/event-stream`) replies. Both now work.

## External MCP Servers No Longer Receive iHub User Details

Tool calls to external MCP servers included iHub's internal context — the signed-in user's
profile, the app configuration and the chat id — alongside the model's arguments. Only the tool's
own arguments are sent now.
