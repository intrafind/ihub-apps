## Installed Integrations: Install from a Catalog, Configure, Bind to Apps

**Admin → Integrations → Installed** is the first piece of the unified integrations platform
(epic #2911). An integration is a definition in a catalog; installing it creates an instance with
its own URL, sign-in mode, groups and set of actions; apps bind instances and the model gets their
actions as tools.

- **Catalog and install wizard:** the wizard is generated from the definition's install fields
  (URL, numbers, switches, choices, a secret), offers the sign-in modes the definition declares
  (no sign-in, or a shared service account whose token goes to the credential store), lets you
  choose groups and actions, and tests the connection before anything is saved. One definition
  can be installed several times.
- **Actions with guard rails:** each action carries its side effect (read, write, destructive).
  Install values are enforced on every call: a result cap the model cannot raise, a filter that
  is always added, a value the model cannot change.
- **Scopes:** when a definition declares scopes (for a data portal: the publishers), users pick
  one per chat like an iFinder search profile, and the pick binds the actions.
- **Cited answers:** a definition declares how results become sources, so every dataset or record
  an answer mentions is linked.
- **In apps:** **Admin → Apps → Edit → Installed integrations** binds an installation, narrows it
  to some actions and sets the default or pinned scope. An app is offered only while every
  installation it binds exists and is enabled; **Admin → Apps** names a missing one.
- **Marketplace:** the new item type **Integrations** installs definitions from a registry. The
  official marketplace publishes the first one with an example app.
- **CKAN Open Data Portal** ships with iHub: search datasets, read licenses, publishers, coverage
  and the list of files with their formats and download links (the files' contents are not read
  in this release), query DataStore tables, on GovData, the German state and city portals,
  data.gov and internal CKAN catalogs. Tested against demo.ckan.org, GovData, Open-Data
  Schleswig-Holstein, open.canada.ca and data.boston.gov; data.europa.eu offers only the search.
