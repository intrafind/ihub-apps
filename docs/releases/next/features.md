## Prompt Library: Your Own Prompts, Sharing and Variables

Signed-in users can now write prompts of their own and share them, and every prompt can ask for
the details it needs. Admin-curated global prompts work as before.

- **My prompts:** create a prompt with **New prompt** on the Prompts page, or hover a message you
  sent and choose **Save as prompt**. Prompts are private until you share them. You can duplicate
  any global or shared prompt into your own prompts to adapt it.
- **Sharing:** share a prompt with specific users, with groups, or with everyone signed in, as
  **Can use** or **Can edit**. People with **Can edit** can change the prompt and share it
  further; only the owner and admins can delete it. Removing a share takes the prompt away at once.
- **Variables:** write `{{tone}}`, `{{recipient}}` or any other name in the prompt text. When the
  prompt is used, a short form asks for the values, checks required fields and shows a preview.
  The final text is put into the chat input, not sent. `{{user_name}}`, `{{date}}` and the other
  global variables fill in by themselves, and `{{content}}` marks where your own text goes. Each
  variable can get a label, help text, type, default value and options.
- **Using prompts:** clicking a prompt on the Prompts page opens a chat in its app, or in the
  default app, with the text ready. The page filters by **My prompts**, **Shared with me**,
  **Global** and **Favorites**, and each card shows whether a prompt is global, yours or shared,
  and by whom. The `/` search in the chat lists favorites, recent prompts, your own, shared and
  global prompts.
- **History:** every save is kept as a version that can be viewed and restored.
- **Favorites and recents** are stored with your account and follow you to other browsers and
  devices. What this browser remembered is carried over the first time.
- **Admins:** **Admin → Prompts → User prompts** lists the prompts shared with groups or with
  everyone. Admins can edit, re-share, delete or promote them to a global prompt, which keeps the
  author's name. The same tab holds the settings: turn user prompts off, limit the prompts per
  user and the versions kept, and choose whom users may share with — optionally only members of
  certain groups may share with groups or everyone. Every change is written to the audit log.
- If the account of a prompt's owner is deleted or deactivated, the prompt stays available to
  everyone it was shared with, read-only.
