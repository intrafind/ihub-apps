# Features — Unreleased

## Prompt Library: Your Own Prompts, Sharing and Variables

Signed-in users can now write prompts of their own and share them, and every prompt can ask for
the details it needs. Admin-curated global prompts work as before.

- **My prompts:** create a prompt with **New prompt** on the Prompts page, or hover a message you
  sent and choose **Save as prompt**. Prompts are private until you share them. You can duplicate
  any global or shared prompt into your own prompts to adapt it.
- **Sharing:** share a prompt with specific users, with groups, or with everyone signed in, as
  **Can use** or **Can edit**. People with **Can edit** can change the prompt and share it
  further; only the owner and admins can delete it. Removing a share takes the prompt away at once.
- **Variables:** write `{{tone}}`, `{{recipient}}` or any other name in the prompt text. When the
  prompt is used, a short form asks for the values, checks required fields and shows a preview.
  The final text is put into the chat input, not sent. `{{user_name}}`, `{{date}}` and the other
  global variables fill in by themselves, and `{{content}}` marks where your own text goes. Each
  variable can get a label, help text, type, default value and options.
- **Using prompts:** clicking a prompt on the Prompts page opens a chat in its app, or in the
  default app, with the text ready. The page filters by **My prompts**, **Shared with me**,
  **Global** and **Favorites**, and each card shows whether a prompt is global, yours or shared,
  and by whom. The `/` search in the chat lists favorites, recent prompts, your own, shared and
  global prompts.
- **History:** every save is kept as a version that can be viewed and restored.
- **Favorites and recents** are stored with your account and follow you to other browsers and
  devices. What this browser remembered is carried over the first time.
- **Admins:** **Admin → Prompts → User prompts** lists the prompts shared with groups or with
  everyone. Admins can edit, re-share, delete or promote them to a global prompt, which keeps the
  author's name. The same tab holds the settings: turn user prompts off (admins can still look
  after the existing ones), limit the prompts per user and the versions kept, and choose whom users may share with — optionally only members of
  certain groups may share with groups or everyone. Every change is written to the audit log.
- If the account of a prompt's owner is deleted or deactivated, the prompt stays available to
  everyone it was shared with, read-only.

## Voice Input: Platform-Wide Defaults

Admins can now choose the dictation service and the transcription model once, under
**Admin → Voice Input → Defaults**, instead of configuring every app.

- **Dictation service (microphone button):** Browser, Azure Speech or vLLM Realtime. Every app
  whose Speech Recognition Service is **Platform default** follows it, including later changes.
- **Transcription model (recording):** used for recordings and audio/video uploads in apps that
  enable transcription without choosing a model.
- Apps that select a service or model of their own keep it. A new **Browser (Web Speech API)**
  choice pins an app to the browser whatever the default.
- If the default names a backend that is not enabled, apps following it keep using the browser,
  and the admin page warns about it.
- Nothing changes on upgrade: the default starts as the browser, which is what "Default" meant
  before.

## Voice Input: Test Microphone, Dictation and Recording From the Admin Page

**Admin → Voice Input** has a new **Test voice input** panel. The tests run in the admin's own
browser with their microphone, on the same path users take in a chat, against the saved
configuration.

- **Microphone check:** a live input level meter and the device name, with no speech service
  involved.
- **Live dictation:** pick Browser, Azure Speech or vLLM Realtime plus a language and mode, then
  speak. Shows the text as it arrives and how long the first words took.
- **Recording:** record up to 60 seconds and transcribe it with any enabled transcription model.
  Shows the transcript and timings, or the error including the server's reason.
- **Azure Speech** gets a **Test connection** button that checks the key and region from the
  server.
- The vLLM Realtime **Test connection** now explains a redirect: an endpoint behind a proxy that
  only accepts TLS is reported as "use wss:// instead of ws://" rather than a bare HTTP 308.
