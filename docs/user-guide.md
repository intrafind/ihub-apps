# User Guide

This guide walks you through the basic workflow in iHub Apps and explains the most common features for new users.

## Getting Started

**First-Time Setup**: iHub Apps automatically configures itself when you start it for the first time! No manual configuration is needed.

1. **Choose a name** – On your first visit you will be asked to pick a user name. It is stored in your browser so previously used apps and chat history can be restored. If you prefer not to enter a name a random one is generated.
2. **Read the disclaimer** – Below the name input you will see the current disclaimer text provided by the administrator. Continue after reading it.
3. **Browse the apps** – After confirming, the apps page is shown. Use the search box at the top to quickly find an app or scroll through the list. The apps can also be sorted alphabetically.

## Launching an App

Click an app card to open its chat interface. Some apps provide starter prompts to help you begin. Others simply show a welcome message or example prompts.

## Chat Interface Overview

- **Message input** – Enter your question or text here. Certain apps display additional input fields for variables.
- **Prompt library** – The book icon opens a searchable list of reusable prompts maintained by the administrator. Click **Insert** to copy one into the input field.
- **Send button** – Sends your message to the selected model.
- **Settings panel** – Adjust the model, style, temperature, output format and whether to keep chat history.

### Message Controls

Each message has small action buttons:

- **Resend** – Send the same message again.
- **Edit** – Modify the message and resend it.
- **Delete** – Remove the message from the conversation.
- **Magic Prompt** – Rewrite your input into a concise prompt with an undo option.

Additional icons may appear when features like file upload or microphone input are enabled for the app.

## Model Selection

Use the **Model** dropdown in the settings panel to choose among the models configured by your administrator. Some models respond faster while others produce more detailed answers.

## Keeping Chat History

Toggle **Keep Chat History** to preserve conversations in your browser. When disabled, the chat resets whenever you reload or close the page.

## Using the Prompt Database

Click the book icon above the input field to open the prompts library. You can search by name or description and sort the results. Selecting **Insert** copies the prompt text into your current message so you can edit or send it immediately.
