# Kerberos Authentication Implementation Roadmap

This document provides a step-by-step implementation roadmap for adding Kerberos authentication with NTLM fallback to iHub Apps.

## Executive Summary

**Objective:** Implement modern Windows domain authentication using Kerberos protocol with NTLM fallback, replacing the current NTLM-only authentication to align with Microsoft's 2024 security recommendations.

**Approach:** Two-phase implementation
- Phase 1: Quick deployment using existing express-ntlm infrastructure (2-3 days)
- Phase 2: Enhanced implementation with node-expose-sspi for advanced Windows integration (1-2 weeks)

**Benefits:**
- Enhanced security through Kerberos protocol
- Seamless single sign-on experience
- Compliance with Microsoft security best practices
- Backward compatibility during transition

## Phase 1: Quick Implementation (2-3 days)

### Day 1: Configuration and Basic Setup

#### Morning (2-4 hours)
**Task:** Update platform configuration for negotiate authentication

1. **Backup existing configuration**
   ```bash
   cp contents/config/platform.json contents/config/platform.json.backup
   ```

2. **Update platform.json**
   ```json
   {
     "ntlmAuth": {
       "enabled": true,
       "type": "negotiate",           // Changed from "ntlm"
       "domain": "YOURDOMAIN.COM",
       "domainController": "dc1.yourdomain.com",
       "debug": false,
       "getUserInfo": true,
       "getGroups": true,
       "generateJwtToken": true,
       "sessionTimeoutMinutes": 480,
       "defaultGroups": ["authenticated"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Verify existing middleware supports negotiate**
