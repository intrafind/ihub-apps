Step 1: Address Critical Bugs and Issues
These issues should be addressed first as they can lead to data loss or unexpected behavior.
1.1. Critical Bug: Potential Data Loss in userManager.js
File: utils/userManager.js
Issue: The loadUsers function is dangerously designed. It attempts to load from the cache, but if a cache miss occurs, it does not fall back to reading from the file. Instead, it returns an empty user object.
Impact: If any process calls loadUsers, then modifies the (now empty) user list, and then calls saveUsers, it will overwrite users.json and delete all existing users. The comment // THIS WILL WIPE EXISTING USERS! confirms this is a known risk.
Fix: Modify loadUsers to safely fall back to reading from the file system on a cache miss.
Action:
In utils/userManager.js, update the loadUsers function.
Generated javascript
// In utils/userManager.js

// This is just a conceptual fix. The actual implementation will depend on how configLoader and configCache work.
// The key is to ensure that a file read happens if the cache is empty.

export function loadUsers(usersFilePath) {
  try {
    // This function seems to have a bug where it only reads from cache.
    // A better approach is to let the config loader/cache handle the logic.
    // For now, let's fix it by reading the file directly if cache fails.
    const fullPath = path.isAbsolute(usersFilePath)
      ? usersFilePath
      : path.join(__dirname, '../../', usersFilePath);

    if (!fs.existsSync(fullPath)) {
      console.warn(`Users file not found: ${fullPath}`);
      return { users: {} };
    }

    const config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8'));
    return config;
    
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Could not load users configuration:', error.message);
    return { users: {} };
  }
}
Use code with caution.
JavaScript
Note: The configCache.js seems to be the intended source of truth. The bug is that userManager.js tries to re-implement caching logic poorly. The best long-term fix is to rely entirely on configCache.get('config/users.json') and ensure it loads correctly during initialization.
1.2. Bug: Invalid React Import in Backend Tools
Files: tools/enhancedWebSearch.js, tools/queryRewriter.js
Issue: Both files contain import { act } from 'react';. This is a library for testing React components and has no place in a backend Node.js environment. It will likely throw an error at runtime or, at best, is unused and confusing.
Impact: Potential runtime errors, unnecessary dependency, and code confusion.
Fix: Remove the import statement from both files.
Action:
Delete the line import { act } from 'react'; from tools/enhancedWebSearch.js and tools/queryRewriter.js.
