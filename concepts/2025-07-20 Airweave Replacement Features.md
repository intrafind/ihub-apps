# Airweave Replacement Features

## Summary

This concept outlines the native reimplementation of core Airweave functionality. The goal is to build equivalent capabilities inside ihub-apps without relying on the Airweave codebase. Each subsection below describes the key feature, design considerations and the relevant components we plan to create.

## 1. Data Synchronization & Connectors

- Build a modular connector framework to pull data from apps, databases and document stores.
- Connectors authenticate via OAuth2 or API keys and normalize source data.
- A chunking pipeline splits large documents into manageable pieces with metadata.
- Change detection uses content hashes to send incremental updates to the vector store.
- Initial connectors target common tools (Google Drive, GitHub, internal databases) with a pluggable architecture for others.

## 2. Vector Storage & Search

- Use an embedding model (self-hosted or provider) to generate vectors from text chunks.
- Store vectors in a vector database such as Qdrant with organization-level namespaces.
- Provide a search API that performs semantic similarity queries and returns source metadata.
- Optionally cache embeddings for unchanged content to reduce cost and computation.

## 3. Entity Extraction & Transformation

- Parse raw data into standardized entities like `Document`, `Message` or `Record` with consistent metadata fields.
- Implement transformation pipelines per connector to map source fields to our internal schema.
- Store original data for auditability while indexing processed text for search.

## 4. OAuth2 Multi-Tenancy

- Support multiple organizations with isolated credentials and data namespaces.
- Use OAuth2 flows for end users to authorize connectors on behalf of their organization.
- Store refresh tokens securely and rotate access tokens automatically.
- Provide administrative APIs for managing tenants and their connected sources.

## 5. MCP-Compatible Search Server

- Expose our search API through an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so external agents can query data.
- Implement the core MCP operations: list collections, search, and stream results.
- Authenticate API requests using token-based auth compatible with our OAuth2 model.
- Ensure responses contain relevant metadata for retrieval-augmented generation.

## 6. White-Label Integrations

- Allow SaaS partners to present our connectors under their own branding.
- Provide OAuth redirect URIs and scopes that can be customized per tenant.
- Configuration files define app names, logos and connection messages displayed to end users.

## 7. Versioning and Incremental Updates

- Track content hashes for each chunk to detect changes since the last sync.
- Store previous versions for rollbacks or historical search where necessary.
- Use incremental indexing to avoid re-processing unchanged data during sync jobs.

## 8. SDKs and API Wrappers

- Offer small client libraries in TypeScript and Python to simplify API usage.
- Each SDK wraps authentication, search requests and connector management.
- Provide comprehensive examples and typed interfaces for quick adoption.
