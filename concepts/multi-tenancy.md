# Multi-Tenancy Concept

This document outlines a simple approach to introduce multi-tenancy to the application. The goal is to allow configuration on a per-tenant basis while keeping the system easy to manage.

## Overview
- **Tenants**: The system supports a root tenant and any number of nested sub-tenants. Each tenant can have child tenants, forming a tree structure.
- **Configuration Inheritance**: Configuration values cascade from parent to child. A child tenant can override any configuration option from its parent, while unspecified options fall back to the parent's value.

## Steps to Implement
1. **Tenant Model**
   - Add a tenant identifier to relevant database tables or configuration files.
   - Store parent-child relationships to represent the hierarchy.
2. **Configuration Storage**
   - Keep configuration records associated with a tenant ID.
   - When loading configuration, merge the parent's settings with the child's overrides.
3. **Request Context**
   - Determine the tenant for each request (e.g., from the domain name or request headers).
   - Load the effective configuration for that tenant using the inheritance logic.
4. **Administration Tools**
   - Provide a way to manage tenants and their configurations in the admin interface.
5. **Default Root Tenant**
   - Use the root tenant as the base configuration. All new tenants inherit from it automatically.

## Keep It Simple
- Start with basic configuration fields and expand as needed.
- Avoid complex permission schemes until the core hierarchy works reliably.
