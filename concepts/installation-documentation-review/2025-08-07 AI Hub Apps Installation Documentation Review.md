3. Restart terminal/command prompt

#### Error: "EADDRINUSE: port 3000 already in use"
**Cause**: Another application using port 3000
**Solutions**:
1. Find and stop conflicting application: `netstat -an | grep :3000`
2. Use different port: `PORT=8080 npm run dev`
3. Kill process using port: `kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:3000)`

#### Error: "npm install" fails with permission errors
**Cause**: Insufficient permissions or npm configuration issues
**Solutions**:
1. On macOS/Linux: Use Node Version Manager (nvm)
2. On Windows: Run as Administrator or use npm config set prefix
3. Clear npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`

#### Error: "playwright install" fails
**Cause**: Network issues or missing dependencies
**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Use corporate proxy settings if needed
3. Install manually: `npx playwright install chromium`

### Getting Help
- Check logs in `logs/` directory
- Enable debug mode: `DEBUG=* npm run dev`
- Create issue on GitHub with error details and system information
```

### 5. Add Verification and Validation Steps

```markdown
## Installation Verification

### Verify Server Installation
```bash
# 1. Check server starts without errors
timeout 10s npm run dev || echo "Check for errors above"

# 2. Verify API endpoints respond
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/models

# 3. Check client application loads
open http://localhost:3000  # macOS
start http://localhost:3000 # Windows
xdg-open http://localhost:3000 # Linux
```

### Expected Output
- Server should start on port 3000
