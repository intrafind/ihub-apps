# Task Scheduling and Async Execution

## Overview

This concept describes a system that allows users to submit tasks for any app and have them executed asynchronously. The goal is to run prompts or other work without blocking the user interface and optionally schedule recurring executions. Users must be able to review past tasks and their results at any time.

## Requirements

1. **Task Creation**
   - API endpoint to submit a new task against an app. The request contains the app identifier, input parameters and optional scheduling information (cron expression or run-at timestamp).
   - Tasks are stored with status (`queued`, `running`, `success`, `error`) and a pointer to result data.

2. **Asynchronous Execution**
   - Background worker picks tasks from the queue and triggers the existing chat or tool execution logic.
   - Worker runs independently from the HTTP request and updates task status and progress events.

3. **Scheduling**
   - Support one-off tasks (run once) and recurring tasks (cron style). A scheduler component checks due tasks and enqueues them for execution.
   - Users can reschedule or cancel tasks via API.

4. **Result Storage**
   - Output from the prompt execution is stored persistently (database or file). Tasks reference this output so users can retrieve it later.
   - Errors and logs are saved along with the result for troubleshooting.

5. **Task History**
   - API endpoint to list tasks filtered by user, app or status.
   - Endpoint to fetch the full result of a completed task.
   - Optional web interface can display task history and details.

## Implementation Notes

- A small task table or JSON file can hold task metadata. Results can be stored as separate files or in the same store.
- `node-cron` or a similar library can handle recurring schedules.
- The background worker can be launched as part of the server process or as a dedicated service using the existing Node.js environment.
- Action tracking events should be emitted so that progress can be streamed to connected clients while the task runs.
