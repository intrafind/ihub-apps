## Authentication and Authorization Concept

This concept outlines a simple approach for adding an authentication and authorization layer to the AI Hub Apps platform.

### Objectives
- Allow anonymous and authenticated users.
- Control access to apps and features through role‐based or group‐based permissions.
- Map user information and group memberships from external identity providers.

### Supported Authentication Methods
- **OIDC with Microsoft Entra** – primary method for receiving user identity and groups.
- **OAuth 2.0 providers** (e.g., Google, Facebook) – optional additional sign‐in options.
- **Local accounts** for development or fallback scenarios.
- Other identity systems (e.g., SAML or LDAP) can be integrated later if needed.

### Authorization Approach
1. Assign each user to one or more groups or roles provided by the identity provider.
2. Define which apps and features are available to each group.
3. Grant anonymous users access only to public apps (e.g., the chat app).
4. Give authenticated users additional capabilities based on their groups, including administrative rights where applicable.

### Implementation Steps
1. Choose an authentication library compatible with the existing stack (Passport.js, NextAuth, etc.).
2. Implement OIDC login with Microsoft Entra to receive user profile and group data.
3. Add middleware to check authentication state (anonymous vs authenticated).
4. Map incoming groups or roles to application permissions.
5. Apply authorization checks around app routes and administrative features.
6. Extend support for OAuth 2.0 providers or other methods as required.

### Design Notes
- Keep the initial version focused on Entra OIDC to reduce complexity.
- Store role and group mappings in configuration files or environment variables.
- Structure the code so additional authentication providers can be plugged in easily later.
