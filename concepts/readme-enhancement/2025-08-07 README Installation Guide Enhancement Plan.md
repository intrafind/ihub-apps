# iHub Apps README Installation Guide Enhancement Plan

**Document Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Document Type**: Product Requirements Specification  
**Prepared by**: Product Strategy Team  

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the comprehensive enhancement of the iHub Apps README.md file to transform hidden installation capabilities into a user-friendly, discoverable installation guide. The current documentation suffers from poor discoverability of key installation methods (Docker, binaries) despite having excellent underlying capabilities. This enhancement will improve user onboarding, reduce support requests, and increase adoption across different user personas.

**Business Value**:
- Reduce time-to-first-success from 15+ minutes to under 5 minutes for evaluators
- Increase Docker adoption for production deployments
- Improve user satisfaction through clear guidance
- Reduce documentation-related support tickets by 60%
