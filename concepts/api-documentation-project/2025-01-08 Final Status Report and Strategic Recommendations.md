- Task 13: Chat Index APIs (Chat routing and orchestration)

**Phase 2: Utility APIs (1-2 weeks)** 
- Task 14: Tool Routes APIs (Tool integration support)
- Task 15: Magic Prompt APIs (Enhanced prompt features)

**Business Value:**
- Complete chat system documentation supports advanced integrations
- Tool system documentation enables extensibility
- Enhanced user experience features documented

### Resource Optimization Strategy

#### Efficient Implementation Approach

**Team Composition:**
- **1 Senior Developer** (familiar with existing patterns) - 60% allocation
- **1 Junior Developer** (for documentation standardization) - 40% allocation

**Workflow Optimization:**
1. **Pattern Reuse:** Leverage established documentation patterns from completed tasks
2. **Batch Processing:** Group similar endpoints for efficient documentation
3. **Template Application:** Use standardized templates from completed work
4. **Automated Validation:** Implement swagger-jsdoc validation in CI/CD

**Estimated Effort Reduction:**
- **Original Estimate:** 40-50 hours for remaining Medium priority tasks
- **Optimized Estimate:** 25-30 hours using established patterns and templates

#### Quality Assurance Optimization

**Streamlined Review Process:**
1. **Self-Validation:** Use swagger-jsdoc compilation as primary quality gate
2. **Pattern Matching:** Compare against established templates from completed tasks
3. **Spot Testing:** Focus testing on complex endpoints only
4. **Automated Checks:** Integrate documentation linting into development workflow
