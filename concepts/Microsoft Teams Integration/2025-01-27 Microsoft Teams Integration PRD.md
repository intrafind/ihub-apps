# Microsoft Teams Integration - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Problem Statement

AI Hub Apps currently operates as a standalone web application, requiring users to switch contexts between their primary collaboration platform (Microsoft Teams) and the AI Hub interface. This context switching reduces productivity and creates barriers to adoption within enterprises that have standardized on Microsoft Teams as their primary collaboration platform.

Enterprise users need seamless access to AI capabilities within their existing workflow, without leaving the Teams environment where they conduct meetings, share documents, and collaborate with colleagues.

## Solution Overview

Integrate AI Hub Apps as a native Microsoft Teams application, providing users with direct access to AI capabilities through:

- A conversational bot interface for natural language interactions
- Personal tabs embedding the existing AI Hub Apps interface
- Message extensions for contextual AI actions
- Meeting integration for AI-powered assistance during calls
