## Configuration Examples Provided

### Secure CORS Configuration
```json
{
  "cors": {
    "origin": ["${ALLOWED_ORIGINS}"],
    "credentials": true,
    "methods": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
    "allowedHeaders": [
      "Content-Type",
      "Authorization",
      "X-Requested-With"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Group Permission Hierarchy
```json
{
  "groups": {
    "admin": {
      "inherits": ["users"],
      "permissions": {
        "apps": ["*"],
        "models": ["*"],
        "adminAccess": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Secure Docker Configuration
```dockerfile
# Non-root user execution
RUN addgroup -S ihub && adduser -S ihub ihub
USER ihub

# Security contexts
COPY --chown=ihub:ihub /app/dist ./
```
